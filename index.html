                <p>Im' a 21 years old guy, I love science, maths, and learning anything about engineering (in other words, to learn about the 
                    practical aplications of science, and how to use software and computational tools related to this). I'm trying to be better 
                    each day, and someday I'm sure I'll become the person I want to be. I'm a very loyal friend, and I would describe myself as a 
                    laugh abuser, very reserved about my personal life, and kind of weird in social enviroments, but I really love to hang out with 
                    my friends. I love the music, right now I'm learning and exploring the world of electronic music, specifically learning about 
                    the House movement in the middle 80's. I also play the piano... or at least I'm trying to learn how to play it, I find it quite 
                    funny and relaxing. If I must mention anything else, it would be that I'm a support main in League of Legends, I love catchers,
